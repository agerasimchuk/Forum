<title>MyForum app</title>

<h1>Overview</h1>
This is the very simple Forum example for collaboration between people.  You can add Comments, with the header and the description, you can "like" any of the comments entries, which will get saved in the Favorites location.

The Photos area lets you share photos from you camera and add comments to the photos.

Finally, this is based on Parse.   Unfortunately, I started developing this app without knowing that Parse will go away, so I've used the SDK and the APIs, and learnt that Parse is going away only couple days before I was ready to submit the project.  It uses the Parse "Login" and "register" mechanism.


<h1>Details</h1>

<h2>Login</h2>
The entry to the app is the login page.  If you are the parse signed-up user, you can login, which will bring you to the Forum Home page.

<h2>Sign Up</h2>
If you are a new user, you can always sign-up.  After you do, you are directed to the Foru Home page.

<h2>Forum Home Page</h2>
Home Page lets you select if you'd like to review the Forum posts (the Forum option), or to look through all the pictures (the Photos option), or simply go to your persponalized spot to see your saved Forum entries.

<h2>New entries</h2>
Both Forum and Photos areas lets you add new Forum Comments or new Photos.  The system will capture the user and display this information in the Forum or Photos area.

<h2>Favorites</h2>
You can click on each Forum post you like which will save the entry in your local cache on the phone (CoreData).  You can remove the saved entries by swiping each one to the left and clicking "delete"."


<h1>Navigation</h1>
The app navigation is using the Navigation Stack which lets you navigate one page after another and get back to the previous visited page in the stack.'
